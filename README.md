[Inappropriateness_sensitive_topics_1.0](Inappropriateness_sensitive_topics_1.0)

In March 2021 we presented two datasets in BSNLP 2021 workshop. The first dataset is dedicated to sensitive topics which include a broad variance of topics which have a high chance of yielding a discussion which can harm the speakerâ€™s reputation. The second dataset is dedicted to inappropriate messages - the messages on a sensitive topic which can frustrate the reader and/or harm the reputation of the speaker. The datsets consist of 25,679 and 82,063 samples correspondingly. To the best of our knowledge the problem of inappropriateness has not been considered before for either Russian or any other languages.
