This repository contains two datasets of Russian texts. The first dataset is dedicated to sensitive topics which have a high chance of yielding a discussion which can harm the speakerâ€™s reputation. The second dataset is dedicted to inappropriate messages -- the messages on a sensitive topic which can frustrate the reader and/or harm the reputation of the speaker.
